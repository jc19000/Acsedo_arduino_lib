### Issues and support ###

If you encounter an issue, you are welcome to submit it here on Github: https://github.com/jc19000/Acsedo_arduino_lib/issues.
Please provide as much context as possible: version which you are using (you can check it in Boards Manager), your sketch code, serial output, board model, IDE settings (board selection, flash size, etc).

### Contributing

For minor fixes of code and documentation, go ahead and submit a pull request.

Larger changes (rewriting parts of existing code from scratch, adding new functions to the core, adding new libraries) should generally be discussed [in the chat](https://gitter.im/esp8266/Arduino) first.

Feature branches with lots of small commits (especially titled "oops", "fix typo", "forgot to add file", etc.) should be squashed before opening a pull request. At the same time, please refrain from putting multiple unrelated changes into a single pull request.
